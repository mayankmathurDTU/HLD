Imagine you have a huge collection of data stored in a database, like millions or even billions 
of items (think of it as a giant list of records, such as customer details, logs, or transactions).
The problem is to rearrange all these items in a specific order, for example, by date, name, or number,
so that they're sorted from smallest to largest or oldest to newest. The challenge is that the database
is too big to fit entirely in your computer's memory (RAM), so you can't just load everything at once
and sort it easily. You need a smart way to handle this without running out of space or taking 
forever, while making sure the sorting is accurate and efficient.

# External Merge Sort for Large Datasets

External merge sort is an efficient method for sorting very large datasets that donâ€™t fit entirely into memory. The process works in stages:

1. Breaking into Smaller Chunks  
   The huge dataset is divided into smaller pieces (chunks) that can fit into RAM. This allows each chunk to be processed individually.

2. Sorting Individual Chunks  
   Each chunk is sorted in-memory using a fast sorting algorithm such as quicksort.

3. Saving as Temporary Files  
   Once sorted, chunks are saved as temporary files on disk. This ensures that only a portion of the dataset needs to be in memory at any time.

4. Merging Sorted Chunks  
   The sorted chunks are combined step by step. At each step, the smallest (or next in order) element from each chunk is selected to build the fully sorted dataset.

5. Efficiency for Massive Data  
   This method primarily uses disk space rather than RAM, making it suitable for datasets that exceed memory limits.

6. Scalability with Multiple Computers  
   The process can be distributed across multiple machines, allowing even larger datasets to be sorted faster.

7. Automation with Tools  
   SQL databases (using indexes) or big data frameworks like Apache Spark can automate parts of this process, simplifying implementation and improving efficiency.
